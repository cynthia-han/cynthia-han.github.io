            <h2> Introduction </h2>
            <p>
                Hi I'm Cynthia! I'm a junior studying Electrical and Computer Engineering at UT Austin. I'm also
                pursuing a certificate in Digital Music Production. In my free time, I like to go bouldering and
                take walks outside. I also love spending time with my friends!

            <h3> Music Production </h3>
            <p>
                My interest for music production began when I was in middle school. I really liked k-pop at the time,
                and as I watched videos of the groups' performances and songs on Youtube, I thought it was really
                cool how some groups could self-produce their music. I really liked seeing how certain artists can
                just sit in front of a computer with a keyboard and begin to make beats that would ultimately become
                songs that are a part of their albums.

            <h4> Academics and Career </h4>
            <p>
                I chose to study Electrical and Computer Engineering because of the classes I took in high school.
                I really enjoyed the Computer Science and Electrical Engineering classes that were offered, and I
                also found Mathematics to be relatively easy. After my first year of college, I interned at Zoom
                remotely (because of COVID) and learned about back-end development and RESTful APIs. In my second
                year, I took more classes related to Software Engineering, which is currently my tech core. The
                summer following my second year of college, I returned to Zoom as a Software Engineering Intern and
                worked on more challenging projects that related to HTTP requests and JSON parsing. Currently, I'm
                taking Probability, which I really enjoy a lot. Because of this, I am thinking of switching my tech
                core to Data Science instead, which would allow me to learn more about Probability, Algorithms, AI
                and Machine Learning.
